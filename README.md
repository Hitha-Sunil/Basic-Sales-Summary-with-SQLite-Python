# Basic Sales Summary with SQLite & Python

# Overview
This project demonstrates how to connect Python with a SQLite database, run simple SQL queries, and generate a basic sales summary.
The results are displayed both as a table and a bar chart using Pandas and Matplotlib.

# Tools Used
Python (Anaconda / Jupyter Notebook)

SQLite3 (built into Python)

Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib (for visualization)

# Dataset
A small SQLite database (sales_data.db) is created with a single table:
sales
id (Primary Key)
product (Text)
quantity (Integer)
price (Real)

Sample records include Laptop, Mobile, and Tablet sales.

# Results
SQL Query Output (example):

product	total_qty	revenue
Laptop	8	575000.0
Mobile	16	332000.0
Tablet	12	184000.0
➡ Laptop generated the highest revenue, followed by Mobile and Tablet.

Visualization
A bar chart is plotted to show Revenue by Product.

# How to Run
